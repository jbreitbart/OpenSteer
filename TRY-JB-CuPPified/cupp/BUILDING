NOTE:
Be sure you start with a clean checkout, so there are no CMake cache files arround.

REQUIREMENTS:
- CUDA version 1.1 installed and working
- CMake

BUILD:
0. If CUDA is not installed in the default directory you have to modify the CMakeLists.txt (see comments in the file)
1. Call "cmake ." or "ccmake ." to generator the build script
2. Build using your local build tool (eg. call "make")

You will find the CuPP library in "lib" and the examples in "bin".
